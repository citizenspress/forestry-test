## Your Collective Agreement

During the PSLRTA Merger vote process, employees covered by a collective agreement continue to be covered by that collective agreement. Rates of pay, benefits and working conditions continue to apply as they did prior to the vote. That’s the law.

When two or more unions represent employees before the representation vote, the collective agreements from these unions form a ‘composite’ collective agreement after the vote. Under the composite collective agreement employees will continue to have the same rights they had under their collective agreement before the vote, with one key difference - all employees, from all unions involved, will be covered by the successful union’s:

-   seniority,
-   job posting,
-   layoff, recall & bumping language, and
-   grievance process

The ‘composite’ collective agreement, along with the successful union’s seniority and grievance provisions, remain in effect until a new ‘first’ collective agreement is negotiated between the employer and the successful union.

## Seniority

PSLRTA requires that after a Merger Vote the successful Union’s seniority provisions apply and that includes the definition of seniority, the layoff/recall/bumping language and the job posting process. PSLRTA also ensures you will not lose your seniority and requires that seniority lists from the pre-merger bargaining units be “dovetailed.” This means the seniority of all employees will be based on the common definition of seniority of the successful union and applied equally to everyone in the bargaining unit.

CUPE’s job security and seniority provisions are the strongest of any hospital union in Ontario and seniority is calculated from date of last hire for full time and 1725 hours equals one year for part time employees. Seniority for all employees transfers over when going from part time to full time or from full time to part time.

## CUPE's Superior Layoff, Recall and Bumping Language 

Hospital workers have made very real gains in job security as a result of OCHU’s commitment in collective bargaining to obtain the greatest possible degree of employment security for our members.

Under the CUPE Central Collective Agreement, the employer must give the union 5 months written notice of any pending layoffs or elimination of positions.

This notice triggers the Redeployment Committee under the CUPE Collective Agreement, which is entitled to ask for and to review all pertinent staffing and budget information related to the layoffs. The union can propose alternatives to layoff and take those alternatives to the CEO and to the board of directors.

All of this must happen before any individual can receive notice of layoff and then all individual CUPE members must also be given 5 months notice of layoff. In addition, packages must be offered to the same number of people that the hospital would otherwise be laying off.

Employers don’t want to layoff CUPE members because there is a domino effect coming as a result of ‘chain bumping’.

The CUPE collective agreement provides for ‘chain bumping’, which is the right to bump anyone with less seniority than you in any job that you can do in the bargaining unit, in any department, on any shift. And anyone that you bump can also bump anyone whose job she can do at any site, on any schedule, on any shift that she chooses. And so on.

Because of our strong bumping and layoff language, CUPE has the lowest rate of layoff and job cuts in the healthcare sector in Ontario.

##  CUPE’s Superior Posting and Promotion Language

CUPE’s promotion language is the better than the other union’s as well as it is the only job promotion language that is seniority based. This means if you are the senior applicant and meet the normal requirements of the job, you get the job. This language ensures that our members aren’t disadvantage because their interview skills are rusty and it prevents the employer from cherry picking applicants.

##  CUPE’s Grievance Process

All grievances related to the CUPE Central Agreement are filed by the Local and arbitrated through OCHU by one of Canada’s leading Labour Law firms. This ensures consistency and protection across the Province. CUPE is based on Local Autonomy so CUPE Locals have carriage and control of all other grievances.
