# Harmonization

With the merger ([under PSLRTA](/post/pslrta/)) you get the successful union’s seniority and Grievance provisions in their collective agreement but everything else has to be negotiated. 

With CUPE that means having the CUPE Central Agreement and then negotiating to Harmonize local issues to the highest rate. 

Things like benefits, vacation, shift premiums and wages all have to be ‘harmonized’.

Collective Agreements vary from union to union and even within the same union they vary by employer or by the group of employees in the union. This occurs because unions put forward bargaining proposals based on the priorities identified by their members. A union local of Clerical employees may have different priorities than a local of Service or RPNs based on their experiences in the workplace. So, normally if you compare Collective Agreements you will find that some wage rates are higher for one job but less for another or that one has better vision care but less for massage therapy. This is why the Harmonization process is so important.

This is also why its important to choose the Union that will be best able to achieve the best new ‘First’ Collective Agreement and CUPE members know that CUPE negotiates to maintain superior protections and improve working conditions in the hospital sector.

CUPE has a great track record of negotiating the best language from each union’s collective agreement into the new collective agreement as well as harmonizing wages to the highest rates and CUPE has never lost an arbitration on bringing all wage rates to the highest level following a PSLRTA Merger vote. Without doubt CUPE is the union best suited to represent workers in health care.
