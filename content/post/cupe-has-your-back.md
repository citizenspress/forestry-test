## No Concessions in Bargaining

**CUPE** has refused to bargain concessions. In our most recent round of bargaining, we beat back employer demands to reduce the Part-time percentage in lieu, chain bumping, sick pay, seniority, and job postings.

**OPSEU** has agreed to concessions, including reducing the Part-timersâ€™ percentage in lieu of benefits to 6%.

## Job Security

**CUPE** has the most comprehensive job security language in the province, including chain bumping. This is why CUPE has the lowest layoff rate of any health care union in Ontario.

**OPSEU** has inferior provisions with limited choices which could leave you in the least desirable shift or location.

## Job Postings Job Postings

**CUPE** is the only health care union with seniority-based job postings. With CUPE, the senior, qualified worker gets the job.

OPSEU has skills and ability first and seniority second, leading to favouritism.

## Wage Harmonization

**CUPE** is 100% successful at arbitrating post-merger wages to the highest wage rate.

OPSEU just agreed to lower the Network Technician wage rate and to red circle the current incumbent. Draw your own conclusions.

## Percentage in Lieu of Benefits

**CUPE** Part-Timers have 14% unreduced, even when in the pension

**OPSEU** has 12% reduced to 10% when in the pension, further reduced to 6% when returning part-time after retiring.

## Part-Time Seniority

**CUPE** Part-Timers work 1725 hours for one year of seniority.

**OPSEU** Part-Timers have to work 225 hours more (1950) to get one year of seniority.

## Pregnancy / Parental Leave

**CUPE** has an employer-paid waiting period and top-up during pregnancy and parental leave and both are 93% of pre-leave wages.

**OPSEU** has an unpaid waiting period and a top-up of only 84%.

## Violence Prevention

**CUPE** has the most comprehensive violence language in the hospital sector in Ontario. The new language is enforceable through the grievance arbitration procedure.

**OPSEU** has no violence language in their Collective Agreement.
