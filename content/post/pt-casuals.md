**_Part-time in pension: CUPE gets 14%, OPSEU gets 10%_**

CUPE will bring all wages to the highest rates. In mergers across Ontario, we have successfully arbitrated every single wage rate to the highest level after a hospital merger.

CUPE is ratifying a 4-year contract with great job security. We set the pattern for part-time staff. CUPE has a strong track record of  negotiating superior language for part-time employees.

CUPE’s definition of seniority is 1725 hours equals one year of seniority.  Compare that to 1950 hours for OPSEU members.

> As CUPE members you will move up the vacation grid 225 hours faster.

With a CUPE Collective Agreement Part-time employees receive the same rights and benefits as Full-time employees such as job security, maternity leave, bereavement leave, safety footwear, vacation, etc.

As a result of CUPE’s seniority based job posting language, after the merger vote, Part-time employees are treated equally in the job promotion process. If a Part-time employee can do the job and they have the seniority, they get the job. And remember with CUPE one year’s seniority is based on only 1725 hours worked.

Also, with a CUPE Collective Agreement Part-time employees can join the pension plan without a reduction to their percent in lieu of benefits.  If you work at least one stat holiday in a year, then having an unreduced percent in lieu of benefits is financially superior to being paid averaged hours for stat holidays not worked.
