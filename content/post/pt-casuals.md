# Part time and Casual Employees

With a CUPE Collective Agreement part time and casual employees receive the same rights and benefits as full time employees such as job security, maternity leave, bereavement leave, safety footwear, vacation, etc.

As a result of CUPE’s seniority based job posting language part time and casual employees are treated equally in the job promotion process. If a part time or casual employee can do the job and they have the seniority, they get the job. And remember with CUPE one year’s seniority is based on only 1725 hours.

CUPE part time employees also enjoy the security of having their scheduled shifts protected as well as being able to exercise chain bumping should they be given a layoff notice.

Also, with a CUPE Collective Agreement part time employees can join the pension plan *without* a reduction to their percent in lieu of benefits.
