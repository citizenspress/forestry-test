With a CUPE Collective Agreement part time employees receive the same rights and benefits as full time employees such as job security, maternity leave, bereavement leave, safety footwear, vacation, etc.

As a result of CUPE’s seniority based job posting language, after the merger vote, part time employees are treated equally in the job promotion process. If a part time employee can do the job and they have the seniority, they get the job. And remember with CUPE one year’s seniority is based on only 1725 hours worked.

Also, with a CUPE Collective Agreement part time employees can join the pension plan without a reduction to their percent in lieu of benefits.
