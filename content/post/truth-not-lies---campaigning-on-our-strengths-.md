**CENTRAL WAGE INCREASE AND RETRO PAY EXPLAINED**

1. The CUPE Central Agreement is negotiated between the OHA and our participating CUPE locals across Ontario. 
2. The Central Agreement only comes into effect when all the CUPE locals have ratified as well as the OHA’s participating hospitals which will be approximately June 1, 2018.   
3. The Central Agreement once ratified by all locals across the Province is retroactive back to September 29, 2017.
4. After the merger vote the Ontario Labour Relations Board (OLRB) will issue a declaration giving the successful union bargaining rights.  This typically occurs within days of the vote if there are no disputes.  
5. If CUPE is not the successful union then there is no retroactivity of the new Central Agreement because there can’t be an agreement with a local union that no longer exists.  CUPE’s current contract will just continue to apply.  
      
   The Central Agreement will apply to all other participating CUPE locals across the Province.
