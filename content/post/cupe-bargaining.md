# CUPE Bargaining

CUPE bargaining sets the lead for all hospital Service, RPN, and Clerical workers in Ontario. Comparing our collective agreements to other unions bears this out. CUPE has superior language on seniority rights, job security, layoffs and recall, and health and safety to name but a few issues. This is true here at KGH and across the province.

CUPE has locked down our contract for the next 4 years, with wage increases. CUPE sets the pattern for Hospital Bargaining in Ontario, we don’t sit back and wait.

## Negotiating the new ‘First’ Collective Agreement

CUPE bargains a Central Agreement with the OHA so after the vote all employees would be covered by CUPE’s Central Agreement. Then the Local Agreement is negotiated with the goal to ensure that the ‘best of’ language from all previous contracts is included in the new Local Agreement.

CUPE has a great track record of negotiating the best language from each Union’s collective agreement into the new ‘first’ collective agreement as well as harmonizing wages to the highest rates. CUPE has never lost an arbitration on bringing all wage rates to the highest level following a PSLRTA vote.

CUPE believes this is an opportunity to not only maintain the hard-won gains from all unions (for example, the highest wage grids, best contract language and benefits) but also elevate other provisions in your contract to ensure you have the best new collective agreement possible.

Often after a merger, employers see it as an opportunity to strip hard-won benefits from predecessor Collective Agreements so after the vote it's essential that we focus on bargaining a strong new ‘First’ Collective Agreement.

For CUPE that means ensuring that there is representation at the bargaining table from the previous union(s) because they know their Agreement language and we want to ensure that we ‘harmonize’ up to the best language in all areas of all the previous Collective Agreements. No one should have to lose rights and benefits achieved over decades of bargaining. Harmonization of superior wages, benefits and working conditions is an essential part of bargaining the new ‘First’ Collective Agreement.

With CUPE’s resources and expertise, you have Canada’s largest union on your side to secure the best new contract that works for you.
