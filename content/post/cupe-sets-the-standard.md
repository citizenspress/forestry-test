## The hospital will try to downsize after the merger

With CUPE’s Central Agreement you will already have the protection you need. When Kingston Health Science Centre starts consolidating programs and departments with CUPE’s solid job security you will be protected. With OPSEU you will still be at the table trying to catch up while the layoffs take place.

## CUPE: the strongest contract by far


### Job Security – chain bumping:

CUPE is the only health care union to have chain 
bumping.  Chain bumping is expensive and 
difficult for the employer and this is why CUPE 
has the lowest layoff rate of any health care union 
in Ontario.  CUPE’s job security protects you from 
having to bump into a less desirable shift or 
location. CUPE Local 1974 has never had a 
member left without a job.

### Seniority based job postings:

CUPE is the only health care union to have seniority based job posting. If you are senior and meet the normal requirements of the job, you get the job.  This means no ‘cherry picking’ by the employer.

### Vacation:

CUPE has no restrictions on when you can take your vacation.  With OPSEU there is a restriction on how much vacation you can take during prime vacation times.

### Early Retirement Benefits:

With CUPE if you retire early you have your benefits to age 65 and the employer continues to pay their share.

### Maternity Leave Top Up:

CUPE’s Pregnancy and Parental Leave is topped up to 93% and you are paid for the waiting period.  With OPSEU you only receive 84% and you are not paid during the waiting period.

## Wage Harmonization after the vote

CUPE has a 100% success rate in arbitrating wages to the 
highest level after a PSLRTA merger.

CUPE will bring all wages to the highest rates. In mergers 
across Ontario, we have successfully arbitrated every single wage rate to the highest level after a hospital merger.

- A strong local: CUPE Local 1974 controls its own resources.
- Central Bargaining: CUPE's great contract
- Ontario's Largest Union: CUPE has 650,000 members nation-wide.
