As some of you may have seen OPSEU has made allegations that some executive members own the CUPE Local 1974 union hall.  This is yet another desperate attempt to distract members from focusing on the important facts and the inferior contract language that OPSEU has or the concessions they agreed to in their most recent round of bargaining.

At the March 10, 2017 General Membership Meeting the CUPE L1974 members voted to sell the old union hall on Concession Street and put in an offer to purchase the new union hall at 680 Innovation Drive.  Both motions were carried unanimously.  Every step of the process including what price would be agreed to on the sale of the old hall as well as the maximum to be paid for the new hall, were approved by the membership.

When the local executive approached the Credit Union regarding a mortgage for the new hall purchase they were advised that the best practice would be for the local to set up a corporation with the table officers as signatories and all members as shareholders.  This practice protects the local and the credit union from anyone being able to make any decisions on their own regarding the union hall.  No executive members own the building, it is owned by the member shareholders.  
  
OPSEU’s Local 443 President stated at an information meeting on May 14th at 6:00 pm that their local only receives $2500 back from the Provincial OPSEU body quarterly.  It’s easy to see why OPSEU doesn’t understand that owning a union hall is normal for larger CUPE locals.  CUPE Local 1974 retains $600 000 a year of members’ dues.  A CUPE local executive is charged with the duty to be accountable for this money.  Owning a local hall eliminates the cost of renting space and is a sound investment of members’ dues which is of course why members endorsed it unanimously.

CUPE is based on local autonomy.  OPSEU says they have local autonomy but they do not.  They don’t understand it and they certainly don’t have the finances at the local level to be able to have it.  Being able to do what you want at the local and community level without asking a Provincial or National body is a key requirement to achieving local autonomy.

We are coming to an end of this campaign and CUPE urges you not to fall for OPSEU’s continual negative, inaccurate and divisive campaign tactics.  We all have to work together after the vote.  CUPE will not campaign by disparaging another union’s members and will base our success on our strong track record of representing our members at all levels of CUPE.
