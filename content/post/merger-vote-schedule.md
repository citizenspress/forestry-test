**On May 16th, 17th and 18th make sure to vote!**

**You can vote at any location** - so if you are not scheduled to work you can go to any poll - any location, date or time.   I

**You do not require your hospital ID to vote** so if you are out and close by but don't have your work ID, don't worry you will be able to vote.

**CUPE members that require a ride** to the poll can email Tammy Bentley at tammybentley63@gmail.com.
