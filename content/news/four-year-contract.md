## Comprehensive violence protection:

Violence protections have been negotiated, including a commitment to a workplace free of violence.

Seniority rights for part-time on disability: Part-time staff will now accumulate seniority while on a disability.

### Note:

This agreement, its wage increases, and retro pay are only in effect if CUPE wins the rep vote this week.

The first wage increase of 1.4% is retroactive to September 29, 2017 for all hours paid. Part-time will get 14% in lieu of benefits on their retro pay.
