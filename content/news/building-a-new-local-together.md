+++
**CUPE has local autonomy** which means we will bring the bargaining committees from the three groups together to develop our local bargaining proposals.  We will survey all our members (it will be mailed to your home) to develop our priorities.

New local union bylaws will need to be developed, answering questions such as: 

* How many executive members will we have? How much will our dues be? 
* Who goes to conventions? 
* When will membership meetings be? 
* How many members for quorum? 
* How will each site be represented.

The membership will then have to approve the bylaws including what the new structure will look like.  

Once those bylaws are approved by CUPE National, elections will be held to form your new Local Union Executive.
