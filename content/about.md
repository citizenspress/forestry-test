CUPE Local 1974 is comprised of 1400 Full time and Part time Clerical, Environmental Services, Trades, Information Technology, Porters, Material Management, PSWs, RPNs and Nutrition. We also represent members at satellite units located in Smiths Falls, Picton, Belleville and Napanee. CUPE Local 1974 is part of CUPE’s Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU) giving us all the benefits and protections of the Central CUPE Collective Agreement.

Our members are very active both within the labour movement and the community and we support our sisters and brothers across the province at rallies and events as well as hosting several community events throughout the year.

## Democratic union

CUPE is a democratic union committed to local autonomy. This means that local bargaining units make decisions about bargaining priorities, grievances and arbitrations and even dues. In other words, as a member, your vote has real strength.

##  CUPE Campaigns

In addition to securing improvements to working conditions at the bargaining table, CUPE also mobilizes public pressure on government decision-makers to enhance and protect public health care. In Ontario, CUPE members run effective advocacy campaigns, on a number of health care issues, including: increased staffing in the public health care system; an end to health care cuts and privatization; legislative protection against violence in the workplace; and a reduction in deaths due to hospital acquired infections and adequate funding for hospital care.

##  CUPE Healthcare

CUPE represents more than 80,000 CUPE members working in hospitals, long-term care, community care and paramedicine, 40,000 of those members work at 120 sites of more than 60 hospitals.

We represent registered practical nurses, personal support workers, porters, dietary, cleaning, reprocessing, trades, clerical/administrative staff, paramedics and paramedical staff.

## Ontario Council of Hospital Unions - OCHU

<img src="/img/ochu-logo.jpeg" alt="OCHU" align="right" style="width: 50%;"/>

Founded in 1982, the 40,000 member Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU) is the hospital division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE).

OCHU/CUPE bargains a provincial collective agreement with the Ontario Hospital Association and lays that pattern down across the hospital sector and for those long-term care facilities that have a relationship with a hospital. Because we have the strongest collective agreement in the province - and because we enforce it - OCHU/CUPE hospital locals have the lowest rate of layoff in Ontario.

OCHU/CUPE carries out advocacy on behalf of our members and on behalf of hospital patients and long-term care residents across Ontario. OCHU/CUPE works closely with the Ontario Health Coalition whenever community health services are threatened with cuts or privatization.
