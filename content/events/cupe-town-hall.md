Hancock became a CUPE member in 1984, and  served fifteen years as president of Local 498 representing Port Coquitlam Municipal Employees. His experience as a local union president  and union activist directly inform Hancock’s priorities since becoming  National President; in particular, giving locals the support they need  to make the gains their members deserve at the bargaining table – and to  push back when they’re under attack.

At the national level, Hancock has been an outspoken voice for  building a fairer and more inclusive economy, and for defending the  rights of an increasingly precarious workforce.
