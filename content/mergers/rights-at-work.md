## What Benefits Can CUPE Provide Me?

These are just some examples of improvements we are confident CUPE can win for you. Without a union, each employee has to negotiate their own wages and working conditions with their employer; but by acting together, employees can have some real bargaining power. A collective agreement ensures that everyone receives equal treatment by the employer and an accountability process if the agreement is violated.

## What Are My Rights?

1. Freedom of association is protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

2. Every person is free to join a trade union of the person’s own choice and to participate in its lawful activities. This is protected by the Ontario Labour Relations Act and the Canada Labour Code.

3. You can talk about the union with your co-workers. Freedom of speech and freedom of association are your rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; therefore the right to speak about freedom of association is protected under the law.

## How Is My Privacy Protected?

A Labour Board Officer holds the vote and this officer ensures that there is no interference by the employer or the union to intimidate or influence the vote. The voting process is confidential and is similar, to Provincial and Federal elections. No one will ever know how you voted and at no time during the process will your employer know whether, or not you have signed a union membership card. The secrecy of the vote and card signer information is protected by law.

## What Is Prohibited Management Conduct?

Section 70 of the Ontario Labour Relations Act prohibits employer interference in the formation of a union:

> "No employer or employers’ organization and no person acting on behalf of an employer or an employers’ organization shall participate in or interfere with the formation, selection or administration of a trade union or the representation of employees by a trade union or contribute financial or other support to a trade union, but nothing in this section shall be deemed to deprive an employer of the employer’s freedom to express views so long as the employer does not use coercion, intimidation, threats, promises or undue influence.”

### Management Cannot:

- Ask whether someone’s joined or is thinking of joining a union.
- Ask about union meetings or activities.
- Call someone into the office to talk about the union, unless that person asks for a meeting.
- Discipline a union supporter for doing something employees who don’t support the union also do but


### My Boss Says CUPE Is An Outsider Unfamiliar With Our Workplace, Is That True?

This is false. CUPE Local 3651 already represents over 450 full-time and part-time workers at Markham Stouffville Hospital, and has since 1994. 

As with all CUPE locals, the Executive of CUPE 3651 is comprised entirely of everyday workers from Markham Stouffville Hospital who have been democratically elected by their co-workers to represent them. 

Members of the local union decide, at regular local meetings, on issues that are important to the local and the membership. Each CUPE local decides its priorities for bargaining, when to settle a new contract, and how to manage funds. 

CUPE’s professional representative staff, and experts in legal, research and communication support the work of CUPE locals. CUPE is Canada’s largest health care union. In Ontario alone, CUPE represents more than 75,000 members working in healthcare. 40,000 of those members work at 120 sites of more than 60 hospitals.

## What Are Union Dues?

Union dues are the way workers who have decided to form a union pool their resources to enable the work of the union. Dues give you access to all of CUPE’s services and benefits, like handling grievances at arbitration, educational programs, research, job evaluation, health and safety experts, pension specialists, equality advocates, lawyers, and professional staff. 

We believe that a percentage solution is the most fair and equitable and part-time employees would only pay the percentage of hours actually worked. 

CUPE locals must collect a minimum of .85 per cent of base wages in dues. Beyond that level, members vote to decide how much their local will collect above the minimum, and how their local will spend the funds. 

On average, most CUPE locals set their dues at 1.5%. Your union dues are entirely tax deductible, and CUPE has no additional application fees.

You will not pay dues until you ratify your first collective agreement.
